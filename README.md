#Commission Task

#This code can be either accessed via page (Web server) or by running the script itself.

-Before trying one of the methods below, make sure to run `composer install`
in order to install the missing dependencies as project is in GIT and vendor folder is in .gitignore.

-This code was running under PHP 8 so I cannot guarantee that it will work on PHP < 8.

1. you can easily run the script by executing `php index.php input.csv` command in a terminal (make sure you are in the root directory of the project).
2. If you would like to see the output in a webpage, then the code must be uploaded in Apache (XAMPP, WAMP, Docker, etc...)

I have created one PHPUnit test as per task requirements and you can run it by executing `.\bin\phpunit tests` in root dir
in order to see the expected output of the first line from the example CSV file (0.60).

Thank you!
